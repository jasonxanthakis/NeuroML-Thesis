This is the repository associated with the research completed for my BSc Neuroscience Year 3 Dissertation.

The focus of the dissertation research is reproducing a multicompartmental model of a human L2/3 neuronal microcircuit, developed by Yao et al 2022, in the form of a rate-based model, using a rate-based model of a mouse V1 microcircuit, developed by Garcia del Molino et al, 2017.
